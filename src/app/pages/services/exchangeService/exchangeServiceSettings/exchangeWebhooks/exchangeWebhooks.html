    <p>Exchanges are triggered by Rehive webhooks. In order to correctly trigger a exchange you should ensure you have at least one webhook of the same
        event type as the exchange event. All exchange webhooks should be configured with the company secret
        because it ensures secure communication between Rehive and the service.</p>

    <p class="text-muted">Note: The "secret" field will automatically get filled with the company secret by using the below webhook shortcut buttons
        or you can manually copy the company secret and paste it in the webhook forms ensuring secure
        communication between Rehive Platform and the service.</p>
